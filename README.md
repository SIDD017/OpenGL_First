# OpenGL_First
An OpenGL based rasterizer.

This project is a first attempt at learning OpenGL Graphics API from learnopengl.com. This project supports model loading through Assimp library by using filepaths in C++.
Advanced Features will be implemented in the future when I get free time from my college semester.
