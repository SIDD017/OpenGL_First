# OpenGL_First
An OpenGL based rasterizer.

This project is a first attempt at learning OpenGL Graphics API from learnopengl.com. This project supports model loading through Assimp library by using filepaths in C++.
Currently working on implementing advanced features, such as Framebuffers and Cubemaps.
